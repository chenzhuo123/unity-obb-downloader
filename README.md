Unity OBB Downloader
==============================
This package is an adaption of the Google Play market_downloader library, for use with Unity Android (as a plugin).

This plugin does NOT solve splitting up a >100MB .apk into .obb (through asset bundles or similar techiniques). It merely handles the downloading of .obb files attached to a published .apk, on devices that don't support automatic downloading.

This software is free and published as is, with no warranty and responsibilities - use it at your own risk.
